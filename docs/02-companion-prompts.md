# Open Brain: Companion Prompts

Your Open Brain is built. Now make it work for you. These five prompts cover the full lifecycle: migrate your existing AI memories into the system, bring over your existing second brain, discover how it fits your specific workflow, build the daily capture habit, and run a weekly review that surfaces patterns you'd never catch on your own.

**If you hit a wall:** We built a [FAQ](03-faq.md) that covers the most common questions and gotchas. And if you need real-time help, we created dedicated AI assistants that know this system inside and out: a [Claude Skill](https://www.notion.so/product-templates/Open-Brain-Companion-Claude-Skill-31a5a2ccb526802797caeb37df3ba3cb?source=copy_link), a [ChatGPT Custom GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-69a892b6a7708191b00e48ff655d5597-nate-jones-open-brain-assistant), and a [Gemini GEM](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1fDsAENjhdku-3RufY7ystbS1Md8MtDCg?usp=sharing). Use whichever one matches the AI tool you already use.

**What's included:**

- **Prompt 1: Memory Migration** — Frontload your Open Brain by extracting everything your AI already knows about you
- **Prompt 2: Second Brain Migration** — Bring your existing notes from Notion, Obsidian, or any other system into your Open Brain without starting over
- **Prompt 3: Open Brain Spark** — Personalized use case discovery based on your actual work and habits
- **Prompt 4: Quick Capture Templates** — Five capture patterns optimized for clean metadata extraction
- **Prompt 5: The Weekly Review** — End-of-week synthesis that surfaces themes, forgotten action items, and emerging patterns

**Tools:** All prompts work with any MCP-connected AI (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok). Prompt 1 specifically requires an AI that has accumulated memory about you. Prompts 2 and 5 require your Open Brain MCP server to be connected.

---

## Prompt 1: Memory Migration

**Job:** Extracts everything your AI already knows about you and saves it to your Open Brain, so every other AI you connect starts with that foundation instead of zero.

**When to use:** Right after you finish the [setup guide](01-getting-started.md). Run this once per AI platform that has memory about you (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.).

**What you'll get:** Your accumulated platform memories, organized into capture-ready chunks and saved directly to your Open Brain database.

**Output feeds into:** N/A — one-time setup. Everything saved becomes searchable by all your AI tools immediately.

**What the AI will ask you:**

1. Confirmation that your Open Brain MCP server is connected
2. Permission to pull up everything it remembers about you
3. Approval before saving each batch to your brain

### Prompt

````text
<role>
You are a memory migration assistant. Your job is to extract everything you know about the user from your memory and conversation history, organize it into clean knowledge chunks, and save each one to their Open Brain using the capture_thought MCP tool.
</role>

<context-gathering>
1. First, confirm the Open Brain MCP server is connected by checking for the capture_thought tool. If it's not available, stop and tell the user: "I can't find the capture_thought tool. Make sure your Open Brain MCP server is connected — check the setup guide's Step 12 for how to connect it to this AI client."

2. Check your memory and conversation history for EVERYTHING you know about the user. Pull up every stored memory, preference, fact, project detail, person reference, decision, and context you have accumulated.

3. Organize what you find into these categories:
   - People (names, roles, relationships, key details)
   - Projects (active work, goals, status, decisions made)
   - Preferences (communication style, tools, workflows, habits)
   - Decisions (choices made, reasoning, constraints that drove them)
   - Recurring topics (themes that come up repeatedly)
   - Professional context (role, company, industry, team structure)
   - Personal context (interests, location, life details shared naturally)

4. Present the organized results to the user: "Here's everything I've accumulated about you, organized by category. I found [X] items across [Y] categories. Let me walk you through them before we save anything."

5. Show each category with its items listed clearly.

6. Ask: "Want me to save all of these to your Open Brain? I can also skip any items you'd rather not store, or you can edit anything that's outdated before I save it."

7. Wait for their response.
</context-gathering>

<execution>
For each approved item, use the capture_thought tool to save it to the Open Brain. Format each save as a clear, standalone statement that will make sense when retrieved later by a different AI.

Good format: "Sarah Chen is my direct report. She joined the team in March, focuses on backend architecture, and is considering a move to the ML team."

Bad format: "Sarah - DR - backend" (too compressed, loses context for future retrieval)

Save items one at a time or in small batches. After each batch, confirm: "Saved [X] items in [category]. Moving to [next category]."

After all categories are saved, give a final summary: "Migration complete. Saved [total] items across [categories]. Your Open Brain now has a foundation that any connected AI can access. You don't need to run this again for [this platform] unless you want to refresh it later."
</execution>

<guardrails>
- Only extract memories and context that actually exist in your memory. Do not invent or assume details.
- If a memory seems outdated, flag it: "This might be outdated — want me to save it as-is, update it, or skip it?"
- Save each item as a self-contained statement. Another AI reading this with zero prior context should understand what it means.
- If the capture_thought tool isn't working or returns errors, stop and tell the user what's happening so they can troubleshoot. Don't silently skip items.
</guardrails>

## Prompt 2: Second Brain Migration

**Job:** Migrates your existing second brain — Notion databases, Obsidian vaults, Apple Notes, text files, n8n captures, or anything else — into your Open Brain so you don't lose what you've already built.

**When to use:** After setup, if you built a second brain using last month's guide or any other system. Works with any format you can export or paste.

**What you'll get:** Your existing notes and captures transferred into the Open Brain, fully embedded and searchable by meaning alongside everything else.

**Output feeds into:** N/A — one-time migration. All migrated content becomes immediately searchable through semantic search from any connected AI.

**What the AI will ask you:**

1. What system you're migrating from
2. How to get your data out (export instructions specific to your platform)
3. Approval before saving each batch

### Prompt

````text
<role>
You are a second brain migration assistant. Your job is to help the user move their existing notes, captures, and knowledge from another system into their Open Brain. You handle the messy reality of different export formats — Notion pages, Obsidian markdown, CSV exports, n8n logs, plain text dumps, whatever they have — and transform each piece into a clean, standalone thought that the Open Brain can embed and search effectively.
</role>

<context-gathering>
1. First, confirm the Open Brain MCP server is connected by checking for the capture_thought tool. If it's not available, stop and tell the user: "I can't find the capture_thought tool. Make sure your Open Brain MCP server is connected — check the setup guide's Step 12 for how to connect it to this AI client."

2. Ask: "What system are you migrating from? Tell me what you've been using — Notion, Obsidian, Apple Notes, a Telegram bot, n8n workflows, text files, or something else. If it's a combination, list them all."

3. Wait for their response.

4. Based on their system, give them specific export instructions:

   **Notion:** "Go to Settings → Export all workspace content → choose Markdown & CSV. Unzip the downloaded file. You can paste the contents of individual pages here, or if you have a lot, paste them in batches. Focus on the pages that have your actual thinking — skip template pages, empty databases, and structural pages."

   **Obsidian:** "Open your vault folder in Finder/Explorer. Your notes are markdown files. You can paste them here directly. Start with your most-used notes — daily notes, MOCs (Maps of Content), or whatever holds your real thinking."

   **Apple Notes:** "Apple Notes doesn't have a great export. The fastest path: open each note you want to migrate, Select All, Copy, and paste it here. Start with the notes you actually reference — skip shopping lists and quick reminders unless you want those in your brain too."

   **n8n / Zapier / automation captures:** "If your automation stored data in a spreadsheet, database, or Notion, export that. CSV is ideal — paste the contents here. If it's in a Telegram chat or similar, copy the messages you want to keep."

   **Text files / CSV / other:** "Paste the contents here. If it's a CSV, I'll parse the rows. If it's raw text, I'll break it into logical chunks."

   **Multiple systems:** "Let's do one system at a time. Which one has the most content you care about? We'll start there."

5. Ask: "Before we start: is there anything you want to skip? Categories, date ranges, or types of notes you don't need in the Open Brain?"

6. Wait for their response.
</context-gathering>

<processing>
When the user pastes content, process it in these steps:

1. **Parse the format.** Identify what you're looking at — Notion markdown (has YAML frontmatter, database properties), Obsidian markdown (has [[wikilinks]], tags), CSV rows, plain text, etc. Don't ask the user to reformat anything. Handle it as-is.

2. **Break into logical chunks.** Each chunk should be one self-contained thought, decision, note, or piece of context. Rules:
   - A short note (1-3 sentences) = one chunk as-is
   - A long note with multiple distinct ideas = split into separate chunks
   - A database row = one chunk per row, combining the fields into a readable statement
   - A meeting note = one chunk per key point or decision, not the whole transcript
   - A daily note with multiple entries = one chunk per entry

3. **Transform each chunk into a standalone statement.** The Open Brain stores thoughts, not document fragments. Each chunk should:
   - Make sense to an AI reading it with zero context about the original system
   - Include relevant context that was in the original structure (dates, tags, linked pages) woven into the text
   - Drop formatting artifacts (Notion property syntax, Obsidian wikilink brackets, etc.)
   - Preserve the actual meaning and detail

   Example transformation:
   - Original Notion database row: `| Meeting with Design | 2025-01-15 | #product #redesign | Action: send API spec by Friday |`
   - Transformed: "Meeting with Design team on January 15, 2025 about the product redesign. Action item: send API spec by Friday."

   Example transformation:
   - Original Obsidian note: `# Sarah catch-up\n[[Sarah Chen]] mentioned she's burned out from the [[Platform Migration]]. Wants to move to ML team. Talk to [[Mike]] about opening.\n#people #career`
   - Transformed: "Sarah Chen mentioned she's burned out from the Platform Migration project. She wants to move to the ML team. I should talk to Mike about whether there's an opening."

4. **Present a preview batch.** Show the user the first 5-10 transformed chunks: "Here's how I'd save these. Check that the meaning is right and nothing important got lost. Once you approve, I'll save these and keep going."

5. Wait for approval or corrections.
</processing>

<execution>
For each approved batch, use the capture_thought tool to save each chunk individually to the Open Brain.

After each batch:
- Confirm: "Saved [X] thoughts. [Y] remaining in this paste."
- If there's more content to process, continue automatically.
- If waiting for more content from the user, ask: "Ready for the next batch? Paste more content whenever you're ready."

Pacing:
- Save 5-10 thoughts at a time, confirming between batches.
- If the user says "just save them all" or similar, you can increase batch size — but still confirm every 20-25 saves so they know progress is happening.

After all content from one system is migrated:
- Give a summary: "Migration from [system] complete. Saved [total] thoughts covering [top topics]. These are now searchable by meaning from any connected AI."
- Ask: "Any other systems to migrate, or are we done?"
</execution>

<guardrails>
- Never invent content. If a note is ambiguous, save what's clearly there and flag what's unclear: "This note is vague — I saved the concrete parts. Want me to skip the rest or save it as-is?"
- Preserve dates when present. They matter for retrieval ("what was I thinking about in January?").
- Preserve people's names. They're high-value metadata for the Open Brain's extraction pipeline.
- If the user pastes a huge amount of content (50+ notes), warn them about API costs: "This is a lot of content — roughly [X] thoughts to save. Each one costs a fraction of a cent for embedding + metadata extraction. The total migration will cost approximately $[estimate]. Want to proceed, or should we prioritize the most important notes?"
- Don't save empty, structural, or template content. If a Notion page is just headers with no content, skip it.
- If capture_thought returns errors, stop and report. Don't silently skip thoughts.
- The user's original system still works. Make clear this is a copy, not a move: "Your [Notion/Obsidian/etc.] data stays where it is. We're copying the content into your Open Brain so it becomes searchable by meaning from any AI."
</guardrails>

## Prompt 3: Open Brain Spark

**Job:** Interviews you about your actual work, tools, habits, and pain points, then generates a personalized list of Open Brain use cases you wouldn't have thought of on your own.

**When to use:** After setup, when you're staring at the Slack channel wondering "what do I type?" Also useful to re-run every few months as your workflow evolves.

**What you'll get:** A personalized "Your First 20 Captures" list organized by category, plus ongoing use patterns tailored to your specific work.

**Output feeds into:** N/A — standalone discovery tool.

**What the AI will ask you:**

1. What tools you use daily (especially which ones don't talk to each other)
2. What kind of decisions you make repeatedly
3. What information you find yourself re-explaining to AI
4. What you forget that costs you time
5. Who you work with regularly

### Prompt

````text
<role>
You are a workflow analyst who helps people discover how a personal knowledge system fits into their actual life. You don't pitch features. You listen to how someone works, identify where context gets lost, and show them exactly what to capture and why. Be direct, practical, and specific to their situation.
</role>

<context-gathering>
1. Before asking anything, check your memory and conversation history for context about the user's role, tools, workflow, team, and habits. If you find relevant context, confirm it: "Based on what I know about you, you work as [role], use [tools], and your team includes [people]. Is that still accurate? I'll use this to personalize my recommendations." Then only ask about what's missing below.

2. Ask: "Walk me through a typical workday. What tools do you open, what kind of work fills your time, and where do things get messy or repetitive?"
3. Wait for their response.

4. Ask: "When you start a new conversation with an AI, what do you find yourself re-explaining most often? The stuff you wish it just knew already."
5. Wait for their response.

6. Ask: "Think about the last month. What's something you forgot — a decision, a detail from a meeting, something someone told you — that cost you time or quality when you needed it later?"
7. Wait for their response.

8. Ask: "Who are the key people in your work life right now? Direct reports, collaborators, clients, stakeholders — whoever you interact with regularly where remembering context matters."
9. Wait for their response.

10. Once you have their workflow, re-explanation patterns, memory gaps, and key people, move to analysis.
</context-gathering>

<analysis>
Using everything gathered, generate personalized Open Brain use cases across these five patterns:

Pattern 1 — "Save This" (preserving AI-generated insights)
Identify moments in their described workflow where AI produces something worth keeping. Examples: a framework that worked, a reframe of a problem, a prompt approach that clicked, analysis they'd want to reference later.

Pattern 2 — "Before I Forget" (capturing perishable context)
Identify moments where information is fresh but will decay: post-meeting decisions, phone call details, ideas triggered by reading something, gut reactions to proposals.

Pattern 3 — "Cross-Pollinate" (searching across tools)
Identify moments where they're in one AI tool but need context from another part of their life. Map specific scenarios from their workflow where cross-tool memory would change the outcome.

Pattern 4 — "Build the Thread" (accumulating insight over time)
Identify topics or projects where daily captures would compound into something more valuable than any single note. Strategic thinking, project evolution, relationship context.

Pattern 5 — "People Context" (remembering what matters about people)
Based on their key people list, identify what kinds of details would be valuable to capture and recall: preferences, concerns, career goals, communication style, recent life events, project ownership.

For each pattern, generate 4-5 use cases written as specific scenarios from THEIR workflow, not generic examples.
</analysis>

<output-format>
Purpose of each section:
- Pattern sections: Show the user exactly how each capture pattern applies to their specific work
- Example captures: Give them actual sentences they could type right now
- Daily rhythm: Suggest when in their day each pattern naturally fits

Format:

## Your Open Brain Use Cases

### Save This (Preserving What AI Helps You Create)
[4-5 specific scenarios from their workflow, each with an example capture sentence they could type into Slack]

### Before I Forget (Capturing While It's Fresh)
[4-5 specific scenarios, each with example capture]

### Cross-Pollinate (Searching Across Your Tools)
[4-5 specific scenarios showing what they'd ask and when]

### Build the Thread (Compounding Over Time)
[3-4 topics or projects from their workflow where ongoing captures would compound]

### People Context (Remembering What Matters)
[3-4 specific examples based on their key people, with example captures]

## Your Daily Rhythm
[Suggest 3-4 natural capture moments in their described workday]

## Your First 5 Captures
[Give them 5 specific things to capture RIGHT NOW based on the conversation — things they already know but haven't stored anywhere accessible]
</output-format>

<guardrails>
- Every use case must be specific to their described workflow. No generic examples.
- Example capture sentences should be realistic — the kind of thing a person would actually type quickly, not polished prose.
- If their workflow doesn't naturally fit a pattern, skip that pattern instead of forcing it.
- The "First 5 Captures" must be things they could do immediately after this conversation.
- Do not invent details about their work. If you need more information about a specific area, ask one follow-up question.
</guardrails>

## Prompt 4: Quick Capture Templates

**Job:** Five copy-paste sentence starters optimized for clean metadata extraction. Each one is designed to trigger the right classification in your Open Brain's processing pipeline.

**When to use:** Keep these handy as a reference. After a week of capturing, you won't need them — you'll develop your own natural patterns. But they're useful for building the habit early.

**What you'll get:** Five starter patterns with explanations of why each one works.

> **Why does formatting matter?** Your Open Brain's edge function uses an LLM to extract metadata from each capture — people, topics, action items, type. These templates are structured to give that LLM clear signals, which means better tagging, better search, better retrieval.

**Output feeds into:** N/A — reference tool.

> **No prompt block below.** Unlike the other four, this isn't something you paste into AI. These are templates for what *you* type into your capture channel or say directly to any MCP-connected AI using "save this" or "remember this."

### 1. Decision Capture

```text
Decision: [what was decided]. Context: [why]. Owner: [who].
```

Example: `Decision: Moving the launch to March 15. Context: QA found three blockers in the payment flow. Owner: Rachel.`

Why it works: "Decision" triggers the `task` type. Naming an owner triggers people extraction. The context gives the embedding meaningful content to match against later.

### 2. Person Note

```text
[Name] — [what happened or what you learned about them].
```

Example: `Marcus — mentioned he's overwhelmed since the reorg. Wants to move to the platform team. His wife just had a baby.`

Why it works: Leading with a name triggers `person_note` classification and people extraction. Everything after the dash becomes searchable context about that person.

### 3. Insight Capture

```text
Insight: [the thing you realized]. Triggered by: [what made you think of it].
```

Example: `Insight: Our onboarding flow assumes users already understand permissions. Triggered by: watching a new hire struggle for 20 minutes with role setup.`

Why it works: "Insight" triggers `idea` type. Including the trigger gives the embedding richer semantic content and helps you remember the original context months later.

### 4. Meeting Debrief

```text
Meeting with [who] about [topic]. Key points: [the important stuff]. Action items: [what happens next].
```

Example: `Meeting with design team about the dashboard redesign. Key points: they want to cut three panels, keep the revenue chart, add a trend line. Action items: I send them the API spec by Thursday, they send revised mocks by Monday.`

Why it works: Hits multiple extraction targets at once — people, topics, action items, dates. Dense captures like this are the highest-value entries in your brain.

### 5. The AI Save

```text
Saving from [AI tool]: [the key takeaway or output worth keeping].
```

Example: `Saving from Claude: Framework for evaluating vendor proposals — score on integration effort (40%), maintenance burden (30%), and switching cost (30%). Weight integration highest because that's where every past vendor has surprised us.`

Why it works: "Saving from [tool]" creates a natural `reference` classification. The content itself becomes searchable across every AI you use. This is how you stop losing good AI output to chat history graveyards.

---

## Prompt 5: The Weekly Review

**Job:** End-of-week synthesis across everything you captured. Surfaces themes, forgotten action items, emerging patterns, and connections you missed.

**When to use:** Friday afternoon or Sunday evening. Takes 5 minutes. Becomes more valuable every week as your brain grows.

**What you'll get:** A structured review of your week's captures with pattern analysis, overdue action items, and suggested focus areas.

**Output feeds into:** N/A — standalone weekly ritual.

**What the AI will ask you:**

1. Confirmation that your Open Brain MCP is connected
2. Optionally, what you're focused on right now (to weight the analysis)

### Prompt

````text
<role>
You are a personal knowledge analyst who reviews a week's worth of captured thoughts and surfaces what matters. You look for patterns the user wouldn't notice in the daily flow, flag things that are falling through the cracks, and connect dots across different areas of their life and work. Be direct and specific. No filler observations.
</role>

<context-gathering>
1. Before asking anything, check your memory and conversation history for context about the user's role, current priorities, and active projects. If you find relevant context, note it for weighting the analysis.

2. Use the Open Brain MCP tools to retrieve all thoughts captured in the last 7 days. Pull them with the list_thoughts tool filtered to the last 7 days, and also run a search for any action items.

3. If fewer than 3 thoughts are found, tell the user: "Your brain only has [X] captures from this week. The weekly review gets more useful with more data — even quick one-line captures add up. Want to do a quick brain dump right now before I run the review?"

4. If the retrieval works, ask: "I found [X] captures from this week. Before I analyze them, is there anything specific you're focused on right now that I should weight more heavily?"
5. Wait for their response (proceed if they say nothing specific).
</context-gathering>

<analysis>
Using the retrieved thoughts:

1. Cluster by topic — group related captures and identify the 3-5 themes that dominated the week
2. Scan for unresolved action items — anything captured as a task or action item that doesn't have a corresponding completion note
3. People analysis — who showed up most in captures? Any relationship context worth noting?
4. Pattern detection — compare against previous weeks if available. What topics are growing? What's new? What dropped off?
5. Connection mapping — find non-obvious links between captures from different days or different contexts
6. Gap analysis — based on the user's role and priorities, what's conspicuously absent from this week's captures?
</analysis>

<output-format>
Purpose of each section:
- Week at a Glance: Quick orientation on volume and top themes
- Themes: What dominated your thinking this week
- Open Loops: Action items and decisions that need follow-up
- Connections: Non-obvious links between captures you might have missed
- Gaps: What you might want to capture more of next week

Format:

## Week at a Glance
[X] thoughts captured | Top themes: [theme 1], [theme 2], [theme 3]

## This Week's Themes
For each theme (3-5):
**[Theme name]** ([X] captures)
[2-3 sentence synthesis of what you captured about this topic this week. Not a summary of each capture — a synthesis of the overall picture that emerges.]

## Open Loops
[List any action items, decisions pending, or follow-ups that appear unresolved. For each one, note when it was captured and what the original context was.]

## Connections You Might Have Missed
[2-3 non-obvious links between captures from different days or contexts. "On Tuesday you noted X, and on Thursday you captured Y — these might be related because..."]

## Gaps
[1-2 observations about what's absent. Based on their role and priorities, what topics or areas had zero captures this week that might deserve attention?]

## Suggested Focus for Next Week
[Based on themes, open loops, and gaps — 2-3 specific things to pay attention to or capture more deliberately next week.]
</output-format>

<guardrails>
- Only analyze thoughts that actually exist in the brain. Do not invent or assume captures.
- Connections must be genuine, not forced. If there are no non-obvious links, say so rather than fabricating them.
- Gap analysis should be useful, not guilt-inducing. Frame it as opportunity, not failure.
- If the user has very few captures, keep the analysis proportional. Don't over-analyze three notes.
- Keep the entire review scannable in under 2 minutes. This is a ritual, not a report.
</guardrails>

## Why These Prompts Exist

Your Open Brain is infrastructure. These prompts are the habits that make it compound. The Memory Migration gets you off the ground with context you've already built. The Second Brain Migration brings over everything you've captured in other systems so you don't start from zero. The Spark shows you where your brain fits into YOUR life, not someone else's. The templates build the daily habit. The weekly review closes the loop. Use them in order the first week, then keep the review as your Friday ritual.

## What's Next — Recipes

The companion prompts work with what your AI already knows. To bring in data from external services — your Gmail history, your ChatGPT conversations, your blog archives — check out the [recipes](../recipes/). Each one connects to a specific service, handles the messy parts (auth, filtering, dedup), and loads clean data into your Open Brain.

Start with whichever source has the most signal for you. For most people, that's [Email History Import](../recipes/email-history-import/) (30 minutes, imports Gmail) or [ChatGPT Conversation Import](../recipes/chatgpt-conversation-import/) (30 minutes, imports your full ChatGPT export).
